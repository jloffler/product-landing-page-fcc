### Project: Product Landing Page
freeCodeCamp - https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page

Build a website using HTML and CSS that is functionally similar to https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL

## Goals
 - Pass freeCodeCamp tests
 - Use semantic and accesible HTML and CSS
 - Make it responsive
 - Make it actually look good
 
## Things I learned
- calc() CSS function
- nth-of-type() CSS function
- alt="" for images that are purely decoration
- embed a video
- create a pure CSS hamburger menu using a checkbox
  - even though this is a poor use of a checkbox, and CSS
  - this should really be done with JS, then the menu can be closed upon clicking a link, etc
- anchor link to specific page elements
- change svg image color in a text editor
- tip of the iceberg for accessibility and screen readers
  - aria
